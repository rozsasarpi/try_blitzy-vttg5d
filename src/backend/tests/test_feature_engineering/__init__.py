"""
Test package for the feature engineering component of the Electricity Market Price Forecasting System.

This package contains test modules to verify the correctness and reliability of the feature engineering
component, which is responsible for transforming raw data into feature vectors tailored for each
product/hour combination.

Test focus areas include:
- Feature creation: Tests for base feature creation from raw data
- Lagged variables: Tests for generation of time-lagged features
- Derived features: Tests for calculated metrics and derived features
- Feature normalization: Tests for standardization of feature values
- Feature selection: Tests for product/hour specific feature selection
- End-to-end transformation: Tests for complete feature engineering pipeline

Common test fixtures and utilities for feature engineering tests may be added to this package
to facilitate consistent and comprehensive testing across all feature engineering functionality.
